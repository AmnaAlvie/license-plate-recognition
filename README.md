This project implements an **Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) system** using:
- [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) for license plate detection  
- [PaddleOCR](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR) for optical character recognition  
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) and [CVZone](https://github.com/cvzone/cvzone) for visualization  

The system detects vehicles and their license plates in **real-time video streams**, draws bounding boxes around the detected plates, and overlays the extracted text directly on the video feed.

---

## üöÄ Features
- **Custom-trained YOLOv8 model** on ~3000 motorway images for robust plate detection  
- **Live video inference** with bounding boxes and text overlays  
- **OCR integration** with PaddleOCR for multilingual text reading  
- **Lightweight pipeline** that runs on video streams frame by frame  
- Fully reproducible with the released weights  

---

## üì∏ Dataset & Training
- Annotated **~3000 motorway images** manually in Roboflow (license plates + vehicles).  
- Conducted experiments with **20-epoch training** locally to validate the pipeline.  
- Final **100-epoch training** performed on GPU with the full dataset for higher accuracy.  
- Model saved as: best.pt


The training reference remains in `notebooks/alpr.ipynb` (training cell provided but not run by default).

## üì¶ Model Weights

The trained weights are available in the **[Releases](../../releases)** section.  

1. Go to the [Releases](../../releases) page of this repository.  
2. Download `best.pt`.  
3. Place the file inside the `weights/` folder:
weights/best.pt


‚ö†Ô∏è **Note on stability**:  
The release was published as a **stable release** . While the model works reliably on many motorway cases, it is still being improved and is not fully production-grade.

# Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) ‚Äî YOLOv8 + PaddleOCR

This project implements a **comprehensive Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) system** that combines computer vision and optical character recognition to detect and read license plates from live video streams or recorded footage. Built during my internship at One Network, this system processes traffic control CCTV footage in real-time with high accuracy.

## üéØ Project Overview

The ALPR system uses a **custom-trained YOLOv8 model** to detect license plates and vehicles, then applies **PaddleOCR** for text extraction. The system provides real-time video processing with live visualization, automatic data logging, and comprehensive detection statistics.

### Core Technologies:
- **[YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)** - Custom-trained object detection model
- **[PaddleOCR](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR)** - Multilingual optical character recognition
- **[OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)** - Computer vision and video processing
- **[CVZone](https://github.com/cvzone/cvzone)** - Enhanced visualization utilities

## üì∏ Sample Output

![ALPR Detection Example](sample_output/image.png)

The system detects license plates in real-time and overlays the extracted text directly on the video feed. Green bounding boxes indicate detected plates with confidence scores and recognized text displayed above each detection.
